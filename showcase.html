<h1>FLAME Summer workshop Showcase</h1>

<h2>Shauna Daly: Radiography for Veterinary Science</h2>
<p>Shauna worked on a rigged model of a cat to demonstrate positioning during radiography.
This involved applying a skeletal rig to a 3D model of a cat and using inverse kinematics to realistically control limb response.

<p>The environment is a 360 degree image of a surgical theatre created by Oliksiy Yakovlyev under a CC0 license and is available <a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/surgery">here</a>.
This can be used to ground a 3D model in a representative environment.

<h2>Richard Downey: Parallel Plate Capacitor Demonstration</h2>
<p>Richard is studying to be a teacher focusing on maths, junior science and physics. 
This demo illustrates the effect of plate overlap area and the resulting change in the behaviour of the gold leaf electroscope.
This type of animation can be used to prepare students for what they will observe in an upcoming experiment.

<h2>Rob Sands: Wheel - Roman/Iron Age Britain</h2>
<p>This wheel is based on examples from two Roman sites in northern Britain. It has two distinct features - a particular type of spoke manufacture that seems to be unique to this period. These are turned on a lathe and have a characteristic double step tenon where the spoke fits into the hub. The second feature is a felloe (wooden outer rim) that is made from a single piece of wood. An iron tyre would probably have fitted over this (not yet modelled!)
<p>
</p>
Often we only find parts of objects like these surviving so a 3D representation that can be taken apart helps students to understand how we visualise a complete object from individual parts found in different locations.

<h2>Lauren Miracle: How a DC motor works</h2>
<p>Lauren is a visiting student working with Dr Nigel Kent from DCU.
They are interesting in developng visualisation of the operating principles of a DC motor from solid model to exploded view to interaction between current flow and magnetic field resulting in torque.
Lauren has created a page to demonstate her work <a href="https://lrnmiracle2.github.io/API_Summer_Internship_Dublin/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<h2>Cathy Roets: Authentic demonstration of Tracheostomy</h2>
<p>Cathy works to build realistic and authentic simulations for medical practises.
In this case a model of the tracheostomy tube was created and paired with a commercially available 3D model of a syringe.
The texture on the syringe was updated using Blender and Photoshop to replace the gradations to match that used in acutal procedures.
This is case the animation was rendered to video using the cycles renderer which uses path tracing for photorealistic light transport.
The result is that the use of alpha channel textures and physically based materials generates a video that is very life like.</p>

SATLE – the Strategic Alignment of Teaching and Learning Enhancement Funding in Higher Education – is a €6.4m funding allocation administered by the National Forum in partnership with the Higher Education Authority to drive teaching and learning innovation and enhancement across the higher education sector.
The 2022-2023 allocation is made up of a share of €5m base funding and an additional one-off 2022 addition, bringing the total fund to €6.4m.
The funding will focus on innovations in education for sustainable development, digital transformation and academic integrity.
