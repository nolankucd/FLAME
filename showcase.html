<h1>FLAME Summer workshop Showcase</h1>

<h2>Shauna Daly: Radiography for Veterinary Science</h2>
<p>Shauna worked on a rigged model of a cat to demonstrate positioning during radiography.
This involved applying a skeletal rig to a 3D model of a cat and using inverse kinematics to realistically control limb response.

<p>The environment is a 360 degree image of a surgical theatre created by Oliksiy Yakovlyev under a CC0 license and is available <a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/surgery">here</a>.
This can be used to ground a 3D model in a representative environment.

<h2>Richard Downey: Parallel Plate Capacitor Demonstration</h2>
<p>Richard is studying to be a teacher focusing on maths, junior science and physics. 
This demo illustrates the effect of plate overlap area and the resulting change in the behaviour of the gold leaf electroscope.
This type of animation can be used to prepare students for what they will observe in an upcoming experiment.
