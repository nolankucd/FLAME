<h1>ðŸ”¥ FLAME: Facilitating Learning with Animation and Multimedia Engagement ðŸ”¥</h1>
<h2>HTML templates to illustrate basic usage of Model-Viewer to display animated 3D models</h2>
<p>FLAME is a <a href="https://www.teachingandlearning.ie/funding/" target="_blank">SATLE</a> funded project bringing interactive 3D to teaching and learning</p>

<p>The links below will bring you to seperate demo pages.
    See the corresponding html files in the project <a href="https://github.com/nolankucd/FLAME/">repository</a> to view the source code.</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo1.html">Demo 1</a> shows the basic steps in adding a 3D model to a web page.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo2.html">Demo 2</a> shows a model with a simple animation and multiple materials and textures.
  An Augmented Reality button allows you to view the model on a mobile device. </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo3.html">Demo 3</a> features a more complex animation created using rigid body constraints.
  These are converted to keyframed before exporting to glb format. A play/pause button is inplemented in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo4.html">Demo 4</a> Illustrates a turbocharger compressor.
  The sweep angle of the blades can be adjusted with a slider.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo5.html">Demo 5</a> uses JavaScript to adjust the base colour of the model's material as a function of the animation time.
  A HDRI background is used to give a photorealistic appearance.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><a href="demo6.html">Demo 6</a> demonstrates how multiple animation tracks can be independently controlled via JavaScript.</p>
